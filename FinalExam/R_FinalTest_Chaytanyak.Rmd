library(forcats)

#1)Using appropriate R code, read in the emailed excel spread sheet
#Collegedata.  Use read_csv(“Collegedata.csv”)

collegedata <- read_csv("Collegedata.csv")
#view(collegedata)
dim(collegedata)

#2)
#Given the level of the institution, does there appear to be an association between
#the average cost of attendance(x variable) and the mean earnings of students six years
#after graduation(y variable)? Make  appropriate plots to justify your response. 
#(Hint: Generate two plots to make your decision, first a standard scatter plot involving 
#the two continuous variables mentioned and then a facet plot over the appropriate categorical variable)

college = collegedata%>%
  filter(COSTT4_A !="PrivacySuppressed", MN_EARN_WNE_P6 !="PrivacySuppressed")

ggplot(data = college)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=COSTT4_A, y=MN_EARN_WNE_P6))

ggplot(data = college)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=COSTT4_A, y=MN_EARN_WNE_P6))+
  facet_wrap(~ICLEVEL)

#From the scatter plot we can say that there is moderate positive association, 
#between the variables-average cost of attendance (x variable) and 
#the mean earnings of students six years.The facetplot also shows that the graph
#has upward trend.

#3)Use r code to produce a histogram of the average age of entry. 
#Comment on the distribution of this variable.


collegedata2 = collegedata%>%
select(AGE_ENTRY)%>%
filter(AGE_ENTRY !="PrivacySuppressed" )
collegedata2

str(collegedata2)

collegedata3<- as.numeric(collegedata2$AGE_ENTRY)
hist(collegedata3)
  
# From the graph we can see that the distribution is slightly skewed to the left.
#We can interpret that the majority of the cases for the average age of entry
#are between 20 to 30 years old.

#4)Use r code that will produce output that shows the 10 institutions that
#have the highest average age of entry?


x4<-collegedata%>%
filter(AGE_ENTRY !="PrivacySuppressed" )%>%
arrange(desc(AGE_ENTRY))%>%
print(n=10)

#view(x4)


#5)There are many universities with "American University" in the name. E.g.
#"American University of Puerto Rico" and "National American
 #University-Ellsworth AFB Extension".  Use R code to create a data frame, called 
#`americandf`, that contains just the data from universities with
#"American University" in the name.

x1<-str_subset(collegedata$INSTNM, "American University")
#x1
americandf<- collegedata%>%
filter(INSTNM %in% x1)
americandf
#view(americandf)


#6)
#Provide r code that will produce the number of colleges from the College Score data frame
#that have average SAT scores that are above 1000.  
#( Do not produce the data frame.  Your code should only yield the number)


collegedata%>%
  select(INSTNM,SAT_AVG)%>%
 filter(SAT_AVG > 1000)%>%
 count()

#7)Provide r code that will show a data frame that lists the 10 highest Average SAT scores in decreasing order. 
#A partial data frame is given below.

collegedata%>%
arrange(desc(SAT_AVG))%>%
print(n=10)

#)8Using the gss_cat data frame, write r code that will produce the bar graph below. 
#And explain in one or two sentences why the bar graph is difficult to interpret.

gss_cat

gss_cat
ggplot(data = gss_cat)+
geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=rincome))

# as you can see, We are unable to read the labels of the levels of the 
#salary (tightly coupled due to lack of space) 
#and therefore it is difficult to interpret the Bar plot. 

#9)a) Now write r code from the same data set that produce the transformed bar graph 
#and comment on why it is an improvement.

gss_cat
ggplot(data = gss_cat)+
geom_bar(mapping = aes(x=rincome))+
coord_flip()

# We can evidently see the difference between the two. The former was difficult to interpret due to
#congested labels of the levels of salary while later one shows levels of the income more defined and 
#easily to interpret after the co-oridinate flip.  



#b)Use r code to produce the tips data frame from the reshape2 package. 
#Name three categorical variables in the data frame.

tips

#view(tips)

#Categorical variables are Fri,Sat, Sun,Thur from 'Day' column. Male and Female form 'Sex' ,
#Lunch and Dinner from 'Time'.

#10)Use r code to indicate how many levels exist for the factor day in the tips data frame
#and determine the frequency of each level.

tips%>%
  group_by(day)%>%
  count()

#11)Produce r code that will produce the following histogram from the tips data frame


ggplot(data = tips)+
geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=total_bill),color='white',binwidth = 2)


#12)Write r code that will produce the following histograms from the tips data frame.

ggplot(data = tips)+
  geom_histogram(mapping = aes(x=total_bill), color = 'white',bins=2,binwidth = 2)+
  facet_grid(sex~smoker)

#13)Using the stringr::words data set along with str_subset code,
#produce R code that will show a 9 letter word that has the letter a in the middle.  

stringr::words
str_subset(words, "....a....")

#14)Produce a string that will force a match for the regular expression \\””\   
#Use and show the R code command writelines to confirm your answer

writeLines(" \\\\””\\\ ")


#15)Describe in words (two or three sentences) what the following regular expression 
#will match ^.*e$.

str_subset(words, "^.*e$") 

#The following above regular expression is fetching all the words that ends with "e" 
#irrespective of the length of the string. 

#16)Using the methods demonstrated in class regarding  Factors and Forcats,  
#use and show R code to create a factor that will enable you to sort the string vector 
#(“eight”, “four”, “ten”, “two”)
#according to quantity, not alphabetical order. 

x <- c("eight", "four", "ten", "two")
sort(x)

SortQunatity= c("two", "four", "eight", "ten")
x1 = factor(x,levels = SortQunatity)
sort(x1)
  
#17)Using the mpg data set, use and show R code that will produce a table that shows the
#average city mileage (mean for cty) for each manufacturer.

#view(mpg)

mpgdata <- mpg %>%
  group_by(manufacturer) %>%
  summarise(MeanCity = mean(cty))
mpgdata


#18)Using the mpg data set and methods and code illustrated in the emailed Factors and Forcats R file:
#use and show R code to generate a scatter plot that clearly shows how different manufacturers compare 
#with one another with regards to average or mean city mileage (cty) 

ggplot(data = mpgdata)+
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=MeanCity, y = manufacturer))

ggplot(data = mpgdata) +
  geom_point(mapping = aes(x=MeanCity,
                           y = fct_reorder(manufacturer,MeanCity),color='red'))


#19)To the mpg data table, apply a stringr function to print all observations of the
#manufacturer variable in upper case letters. Thenuse R coding to produce rows 15 to 25.  
#The first five rows of the table are shown below. 
#Note that the row numbers 1 – 5 correspond to rows 15 – 20.

mpg$manufacturer<-str_to_upper(mpg$manufacturer)
mpg

mpgdata2<- mpg%>%
  select(manufacturer, model, year)%>%
  slice(15:25)

mpgdata2


#20)To the diamonds data table, apply R code to produce the table give below.
#Note that the variable name color has been changed to Color

diamonds

diamond1 <- diamonds%>%
  group_by(color)%>%
  count()%>%
  rename(Color = 'color', Frequency = 'n')%>%
  arrange(desc(Frequency))

diamond1

#21)  Now using the table produced in problem 20 and ggplot coding, produce the bar graph shown below.


ggplot(data=diamond1)+
  geom_bar(mapping = aes(y = Frequency,x=Color,fill=Color),stat="identity")



```
